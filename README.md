# iSTBench
We developed a comprehensive benchmarking pipeline to evaluate state-of-the-art multi-slice integration methods across diverse technologies. Our evaluation framework includes both multi-slice integration performance and three critical downstream applications that utilize the integrated embeddings, including spatial clustering, spatial alignment, and slice representation. Beyond benchmarking, we examine the relationship between upstream integration and downstream performance, identify task-specific limitations, and propose modular solutions to overcome them. To support this, we curated 19 spatial transcriptomics datasets from seven sources, encompassing multiple technologies such as 10X Visium, BaristaSeq, MERFISH, and STARMap, to benchmark eight multi-slice integration methods.

**8** methods are included:
