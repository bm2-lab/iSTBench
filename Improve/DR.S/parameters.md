## DR.S.R
The script takes in an h5ad file containing slices integration and spatial clustering results based on a specific method and performs slice characterization and clustering based on domain abundance and correlation. The input h5ad file must contain two metadata columns in `data.obs`: `predicted_domain` and `slices_class`. The `predicted_domain` column corresponds to the identified domain labels, and the `slices_class` column corresponds to the labels of the slices themselves. If the slice class is unknown, it can be set to "unknown".

```python
Parameters:
file (abbreviation: f): Path to the input data file (H5AD format). This is the result file for the specific integration method.
output (abbreviation: o): Directory where output files will be saved.
cluster_number (abbreviation: c):  The number of clusters to generate during the clustering step.
step (abbreviation: P): The step size for the domain density distribution collection.
sd_filter (abbreviation: S): The threshold for filtering slice representation based on domain-domain similarity. If the similarity between two domains is below the sd_filter value, their similarity will not be considered when representing the slice. This is an optional parameter, with the default set to 0.
